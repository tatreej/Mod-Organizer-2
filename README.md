# Mod-Organizer-2
Mod Organizer 2 is an advanced mod management tool for Bethesda games that uses a virtual file system to keep the original game installation untouched. It allows users to manage load order, resolve mod conflicts, create multiple profiles, and safely install, test, and remove mods without affecting game files.
