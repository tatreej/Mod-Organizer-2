**Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)** is a powerful mod management tool designed for advanced users and modding enthusiasts. It allows you to manage, install, and organize mods for Bethesda games and other supported titles while keeping the original game directory completely clean.

MO2 uses a virtual file system to isolate mods from the base game, providing maximum control, flexibility, and stability.
